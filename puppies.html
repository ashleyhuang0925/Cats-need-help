				<h1><marquee>Puppies</marquee></h1>
				<p> Have you ever wanted a puppy? Do you know what kind to get? As you may know, there are many different types of puppies. There are cute ones, fluffy ones, mean ones, big ones, small ones, and even lazy ones. Today, you will know about the 4 following puppies.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Golden Retrievers</li>
					<li>Beagles</li>
					<li>Shibas</li>
          				<li>Poodles</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Golden Retrievers</h2>

				<h2>Beagles</h2>
				<p>Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike. Canines in this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative training techniques. Their noses guide them through life, and they’re never happier than when following an interesting scent.</p>

        			<h2>Poodles</h2>
				<p> Poodles are elegant, clever, and win many fashion awards. Their curly hair makes them much different from other dogs. They have a bigger chance in winning fashion competitions because of their beautifulness and their gracefulness.</p>

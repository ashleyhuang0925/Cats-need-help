				<h1><marquee>All About Me</marquee></h1>
				<p>My name is Ashley. I am going to talk about myself. I have many different hobbies and pastimes. Today I will tell you about my following activities.</p>
					<p>music</p>
					<p>dancing</p>
					<p>making slime</p>
				<h2>Music</h2>
				<p>I am playing violin and piano. I have also won many competitions. Although I sometimes play my ukelele as my pastimes, I still play violin and piano more often. Violin and piano have different challenges. Violin has a big challenge with having to play the pitch perfect or else it will sound wierd. In piano, you have to play the right notes or chords. A chord is when you play two or more notes at the same time.</p>

				<h2>Dancing</h2>
				<p>One of my favorite hobbies is dancing. There are many different kinds of dancing. There is ballet, contemparary, jazz, hipop, etc. I am actually really flexible and I have went to many competitions before. Dancing is really fun because you get to play backstage with your friends at rehersals, recitals, and competitions.</p>

				<h2>Slime</h2>
				<p> Making slime is one of my hobbies and pastimes. A lot of children in the world love playing with slime and I am one of those people. I know most of the adults will think,"What's the point of making slime?" Well, I don't think there is a point but seeing it clump together and playing with it is really fascinating.</p>

				<p>As you can see, I have showed you a few of my pastimes and hobbies. Some, you might like doing or already are doing. See how many out of these three you do. Well, that is it for my "All About Me".</p>

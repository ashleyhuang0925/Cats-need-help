				<h1><marquee>All About Me</marquee></h1>
				<p>My name is Ashley. I am going to talk about myself. I have many different hobbies and pastimes. Today I will tell you about my following activities.</p>
					<p>music</p>
					<p>dancing</p>
					<p>making slime</p>
				<h2>Music</h2>
				<p>I am playing violin and piano. I have also won many competitions. Although I sometimes play my ukelele as my pastimes, I still play violin and piano more often. Violin and piano have different challenges. Violin has a big challenge with having to play the pitch perfect or else it will sound wierd. In piano, you have to play the right notes or chords. A chord is when you play two or more notes at the same time.</p>

				<h2>Dancing</h2>
				<p>One of my favorite hobbies is dancing. There are many different kinds of dancing. There is ballet, contemparary, jazz, hipop, etc. I am actually really flexible and I have went to many competitions before. Dancing is really fun because you get to play backstage with your friends at rehersals, recitals, and competitions.</p>

				<h2>Slime</h2>
				<p> Making slime is one of my hobbies and pastimes. A lot of children in the world love playing with slime and I am one of those people. I know most of the adults will think,"What's the point of making slime?" Well, I don't think there is a point but seeing it clump together and playing with it is really fascinating.</p>
